# ### Generating a Time series
# To create a synthetic jet power time-series, we use an input power spectral density (PSD) and jet power probability density function (PDF) to generate a time series for the jet power for a given set of PSD and PDF parameters. We use the method described by \cite{emmanoulopoulos_generating_2013} and implemented in python by \cite{connolly_python_2015}. The algorithm is similar to the widely used \cite{timmer_generating_1995} method, except that it allows for flexibility in specifying the PDF by not enforcing random phases. The PSD is specified as a power-law model of the form 
# $$
#     \mathrm{PSD}(f) \propto f^{-\alpha}
#     % A(\tilde{Q}) {f^{-\alpha}}}             
# $$
# where $f$ is the temporal frequenc, and the spectral index $\alpha=1$ for a pink or flicker noise spectrum. We use a log-normal distribution of jet powers as our input PDF, given by
# $$
# p(Q) = \frac{1}{Q\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left[ -\frac{(\ln Q-\ln Q_0)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right],
# $$
# where $\ln Q_0$ is the natural logarithm of the median jet power 
# and $\sigma$ is the natural logarithm of the standard deviation. The mean and mode of the distribution are given by $\exp(\ln Q_0-\sigma^2/2)$ and $\exp(\ln Q_0-\sigma^2)$ respectively. 
# 
# To do this, we will use the python package [DELCgen](https://github.com/samconnolly/DELightcurveSimulation).
